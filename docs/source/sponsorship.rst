Sponsorship opportunities
-------------------------

Building and maintaining software takes a lot of time and effort. On top
of that, we have to cover running expenses such as cloud services.

All PySNMP `products <https://www.pysnmp.com/#our-projects>`_ and public
services are free of charge, software is open source and the
`licensing model <https://www.pysnmp.com/license.html>`_ is extremely
permissive.

To keep our products at the edge of technology, the PySNMP Organization is offering
consulting services and sponsorship opportunities. If you are looking
to:

* Bring new features to any of `pysnmp.com <https://www.pysnmp.com/#our-projects>`_ projects
* Launch a new project in our knowledge domain
* Get priority issues resolution
* Get software integration assistance
* Have you logo on PySNMP Sponsors page

please do not hesitate to `reach out <mailto:support@lextudio.com>`_ - we
will be happy to help!
